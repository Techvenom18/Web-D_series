*Description:* This series teaches HTML from the ground up. Starting with the anatomy of an HTML document, we move to semantic tags, multimedia embedding, responsive friendly structure, form handling, and accessibility practices. Every lesson includes a live coded example and a small project so you practice immediately. By the end, youâ€™ll be able to create clean, well structured pages ready for CSS and JavaScript.
